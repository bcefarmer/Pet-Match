# Pet-Match

Anyone looking to adopt a pet in their area this is the website for you. You can create a secure login from which you can search for dogs, cats, a parrot, or even exotic animals like monkeys or snakes. Which type of breed you would like. How big of pet you are looking for and more. The application will tell you where these pets are located and provides contact information so you can call directly or click the link to the pet's profile for further details about this specific animal.

## User Story

I AM looking to adopt an animal.
I CAN create a personal account with a secure password. 
WHEN I filter for a certain animal, 
I AM presented with results from PetFinder.com.
I AM presented with multiple pets that meet my criteria.
WHEN deciding, 
I CAN call the shelter directly from the page to inquire about the pet.
I CAN jot down information I would like to keep in mind.
 
## Installation
If you are installing to your local machine please remember to add a .env file

## Future Development

Moving forward we would like to add to the application by including functionality allowing us to search the area and get a response with available animals in our area.  
Adding an exotic animal's search option to the application would really give it a unique touch.
Adding the ability for a user to delete their notes.
Working through the technical difficulties we encountered with Twilio
